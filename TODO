* Calibrations greater than 7 are broken
* There's a bug right now where on the first run through a problem where you 
	specify a correct pre_ind_plu using the unknown setter, the brain farts 
	and it answers incorrectly, but if rerun answers just fine.
	Repro steps:
		* Remove brain
		* Answer calibration 7
